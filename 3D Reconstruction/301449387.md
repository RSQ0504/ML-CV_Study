## 3.1 Sparse reconstruction

### 3.1.1 Implement the eight point algorithm (2 pts)

```python
F =[[ 3.37554374e-09 -5.77488650e-08 -1.44640637e-05]
 [-1.29390178e-07 -1.48285427e-09  1.12458135e-03]
 [ 3.25298454e-05 -1.08034741e-03 -4.55969209e-03]]
```

### 3.1.2 Find epipolar correspondences (2 pts)

**The similarity metric you decided to use is NCC. It is robust to Lighting and Shading Variations and can find instances of a smaller template within a larger image. **

**However it is sensitive to noise in the data. In the following instance, the orange/red point on the pillar in image 1 is matched on the other pilllar in image 2. The details of the pillars are similar. In this case, the matching results are easily confused or affected by noise.**

### 3.1.3 Write a function to compute the essential matrix (2 pts)

```python
E = [[ 0.00780296 -0.13397612 -0.04211513]
 [-0.30018241 -0.00345263  1.6557511 ]
 [ 0.00244448 -1.67570084 -0.00192676]]
```



### 3.1.4 Implement triangulation (2 pts)

**I determined which extrinsic matrices are correct by counting the 3D points which are in front of both cameras (positive depth) in each condition. I picked the one for which most of the 3D points are in front of both cameras (positive depth).**

```python
for i in range(P2_possible_e.shape[-1]):
    temp_p2_e = P2_possible_e[:,:,i]
    temp_P2 = np.dot(k2,temp_p2_e)
    points = triangulate(P1, pts1, temp_P2, pts2)
    front_count = 0
    for point in points:
        if point[-1]>0:
            front_count += 1
    if front_count > best:
        best = front_count
        P2 = temp_P2
        R2 = temp_p2_e[:,:-1]
        t2 = temp_p2_e[:,-1].reshape(-1,1)
        result_points = points
```
